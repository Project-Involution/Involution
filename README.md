# Involution

***No matter what you want to learn, we get you accompany.***

## What do we do?

Involuion serves as an online study group platform. It provides an efficient way for you to find peers and join in a group when you want to learn some skills or prepare for tests. Study groups are created for people with similar goals, such as preparing for the TOEFL test or learning web app development.

There is a maximum of four people in each study group. All group members are required to make plans based on the specific topic. And all members are the superviser of each others so that you can study and challenge yourselve together.

## Why is study group important?

In the path of improving ourselves, we will want to learn some skills outside of classroom or workplace to discover more life possibilities. However, learning without peers and tutors are lonely. We need some peer pressure to keep our minds up and finish extra study task after a long day at school/work. Joining study group can have peers studying together, monitoring each other. We created a sense of "classroom" with the Involution study group.

## How can you use it?

For new users, after signing up, you are directed to your dashboead, where you can check group activity, personal studying plans and the heat map. And you can also discover new groups or make new plans on your dashboard.

We made several rules for you to better focus and stop procrastinating:

+ All users can only join one group at a time. We encourage you to focus on one goal before you start another topic.
  
+ In a new formed group, each member should make a ultimate goal with quantifiable descriptions and specific deadline. Then, set up monthly plans, weekly plans and daily plans based on your goal.
  
  + For example, an ultimate goal could be "getting 100 on the TOEFL test in November"; monthly plans could be "finish 5 sets of TPO with accuate rate higher than 90%".
  
+ Users are encouraged to use our reward and punishment system. You can put some money into our pool (no less that 30 dollars). If you achieve your ultimate goal on time, we will refund you 85% of the amount. When all of your group member finish their goals, the rest 15% will be returned.

Good luck in improving yourself!
