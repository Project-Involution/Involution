# Involution

***No matter what you want to learn, we get you accompany.***

## What do we do?

Involuion serves as a online study group platform. It provides an efficient way for you to find peers and join in a group when you want to learn some skill or prepare for tests. Study groups are created for people with same purpose, for example, preparing for TOEFL test or learning web app development.

There is a maximum of four people in each study group. All group members are required to make plans based on the specific topic. And all members are the superviser. We encourage you to study and challenge yourselve together.

## Why is study group important?

In the path of improving ourselves, we will want to learn some skills outside of classroom or workplace to discover more life possibilities. However, learning without peers and tutors are lonely. We need some peer pressure to keep our minds up and finish extra study task after a long day at school/work. Joining study group can have peers studying together, monitoring each other. We created a sense of "classroom" with the Involution study group.

## How can you use it?

For new users, you can create an Involution account with your e-mail. After signing up, you are directed to your dashboead, where you can check your group activity, personal studying plans and heat map. And you can also discover new groups or make new plans on your dashboard.

All users can only join one group at a time. We encourage you to focus on learning one thing before you start another topic.

Good luck in improving yourself!
